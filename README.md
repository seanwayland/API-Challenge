# pythonAPI

Using Python and APIs to answer the question What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
1) In the nothern hemishpere Temperature decreases as you go away from the equator in March. 
For every degree of latitude temp in farenheight goes down by roughly .7 degrees Farenheight 
2) In the southern hemishpere Temperature  as you increases away from the equatorin March. 
For every degree of latitude temp in farenheight goes up by roughly .25 degrees Farenheight 
3) In both hemisphere's humitidy increases as you go further away from the equator in March.

API calls and citypy code is commented out and the data is imported from a previous call I made.
